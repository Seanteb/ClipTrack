# ClipTrack
A script which can get a vague location of someone, just based off of their phone number.

USAGE:
This is a project that I had worked on for a few days for fun. It cannot be used to track personal phone numbers and isn't always very percise, I just thought it was fun to make. I couldn't run the script on its own, so I created that secondary script to just run it. You honestly don't need a tutorial, You'll get the hang of it!!
